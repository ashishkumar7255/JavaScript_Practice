        <h3 id="alen">Musk developed an interest in technology and entrepreneurship at an early age. He taught himself
            computer programming and sold his first software, a game called Blastar, at the age of 12. After moving to
            the United States, he attended the University of Pennsylvania, earning degrees in Physics and Economics. He
            then briefly joined a Ph.D. program at Stanford University but dropped out after two days to pursue his
            entrepreneurial dreams.Musk's first major success was Zip2, a web software company that provided business
            directories and maps to newspapers. He sold Zip2 for nearly $300 million and co-founded X.com, an online
            payment company that later became PayPal. When eBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion, Musk received
            a significant financial boost, allowing him to invest in more ambitious projects.</h3>
        <h3 id="steve">Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California. He was adopted by Paul
            and Clara Jobs, who nurtured his interest in electronics and mechanics. Jobs attended Reed College but
            dropped out after six months, preferring to learn through personal exploration. He later traveled to India
            in search of spiritual enlightenment, an experience that influenced his design philosophy.In 1976, Jobs
            co-founded Apple with his friend Steve Wozniak in his parents garage. They created the Apple I, a personal
            computer that gained attention for its innovative design. This was followed by the Apple II, which became
            one of the first mass-produced personal computers. In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, a computer with a graphical user interface and a mouse—revolutionary
            concepts at the time. However, due to internal conflicts, Jobs was forced to leave Apple in 1985</h3>
